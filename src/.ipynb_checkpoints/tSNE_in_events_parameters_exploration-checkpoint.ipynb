    "# tSNE for events and exploration of tSNE parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "''' Created on Tue 04 Aug 2020'''\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will analyze periods of exploratory behaviour without taking into account the object that is being explore. We will take the first 6 seconds of exploration (because we are currently using a re sampling of 20 frames that gives us 2s bins, just to use a multipler), if posible some segment in the middle and the resting periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the impact of the perplexity parameter and number of iterations of tSNE rutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "And also, we will use the tSNE rutine for raw data and for correlation matrix data. The idea is to study the underling structure of traces in time and also of neural correlations. For both cases we will do a paramenter exploration for tSNE."
