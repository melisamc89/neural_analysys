# neural_analysys on calcium traces
This is the repository for rutines particularly built to analysis of calcium traces

Analysis is build up in multiple jupiter notebooks for different type of analysis: correlation matrix between temporal traces
of neural activity, PCA performed directly on the temporal traces, multidimensional analysis and so on.

Some plotting functions are provided in the figures files, and statistical functions for analysis in general stats.

For using this rutines calcium traces and behavioural files are required
